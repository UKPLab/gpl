# Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL)
GPL is an unsupervised domain adaptation method for training dense retrievers. It is based on query generation and pseudo labeling with powerful cross-encoders. To train a domain-adapted model, it needs only the unlabeled target corpus and can achieve significant improvement over zero-shot models.

For more information, checkout our publication:
- [GPL: Generative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07577) (NAACL 2022)

For reproduction, please refer to this [snapshot branch](https://github.com/UKPLab/gpl/tree/reproduction-snapshot).

## Installation
One can either install GPL via `pip`
```bash
pip install gpl
```
or via `git clone`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UKPLab/gpl.git && cd gpl
pip install -e .
```
> Meanwhile, please make sure the [correct version of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) has been installed according to your CUDA version.

## Usage
GPL accepts data in the [BeIR](https://github.com/UKPLab/beir)-format. For example, we can download the [FiQA](https://sites.google.com/view/fiqa/) dataset hosted by BeIR:
```bash
wget https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/thakur/BEIR/datasets/fiqa.zip
unzip fiqa.zip
head -n 2 fiqa/corpus.jsonl  # One can check this data format. Actually GPL only need this `corpus.jsonl` as data input for training.
```
Then we can either use the `python -m` function to run GPL training directly:
```bash
export dataset="fiqa"
python -m gpl.train \
    --path_to_generated_data "generated/$dataset" \
    --base_ckpt "distilbert-base-uncased" \
    --gpl_score_function "dot" \
    --batch_size_gpl 32 \
    --gpl_steps 140000 \
    --new_size -1 \
    --queries_per_passage -1 \
    --output_dir "output/$dataset" \
    --evaluation_data "./$dataset" \
    --evaluation_output "evaluation/$dataset" \
    --generator "BeIR/query-gen-msmarco-t5-base-v1" \
    --retrievers "msmarco-distilbert-base-v3" "msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3" \
    --retriever_score_functions "cos_sim" "cos_sim" \
    --cross_encoder "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2" \
    --qgen_prefix "qgen" \
    --device "cuda:0" \
    --do_evaluation \
    # --use_amp   # Use this for efficient training if the machine supports AMP

# One can run `python -m gpl.train --help` for the information of all the arguments
# To reproduce the experiments in the paper, set `base_ckpt` to "GPL/msmarco-distilbert-margin-mse" (https://huggingface.co/GPL/msmarco-distilbert-margin-mse)
```
or import GPL's trainining method in a python script:
```python
import gpl

dataset = 'fiqa'
gpl.train(
    path_to_generated_data=f"generated/{dataset}",
    base_ckpt="distilbert-base-uncased",  
    # base_ckpt='GPL/msmarco-distilbert-margin-mse',  
    # The starting checkpoint of the experiments in the paper
    gpl_score_function="dot",
    # Note that GPL uses MarginMSE loss, which works with dot-product
    batch_size_gpl=32,
    gpl_steps=140000,
    new_size=-1,
    # Resize the corpus to `new_size` (|corpus|) if needed. When set to None (by default), the |corpus| will be the full size. When set to -1, the |corpus| will be set automatically: If QPP * |corpus| <= 250K, |corpus| will be the full size; else QPP will be set 3 and |corpus| will be set to 250K / 3
    queries_per_passage=-1,
    # Number of Queries Per Passage (QPP) in the query generation step. When set to -1 (by default), the QPP will be chosen automatically: If QPP * |corpus| <= 250K, then QPP will be set to 250K / |corpus|; else QPP will be set 3 and |corpus| will be set to 250K / 3
    output_dir=f"output/{dataset}",
    evaluation_data=f"./{dataset}",
    evaluation_output=f"evaluation/{dataset}",
    generator="BeIR/query-gen-msmarco-t5-base-v1",
    retrievers=["msmarco-distilbert-base-v3", "msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3"],
    retriever_score_functions=["cos_sim", "cos_sim"],
    # Note that these two retriever model work with cosine-similarity
    cross_encoder="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",
    qgen_prefix="qgen",
    # This prefix will appear as part of the (folder/file) names for query-generation results: For example, we will have "qgen-qrels/" and "qgen-queries.jsonl" by default.
    do_evaluation=True,
    # use_amp=True   # One can use this flag for enabling the efficient float16 precision
)
```

## How does GPL work?
The workflow of GPL is shown as follows:
![](imgs/GPL.png)
1. GPL first use a seq2seq (we use [BeIR/query-gen-msmarco-t5-base-v1](https://huggingface.co/BeIR/query-gen-msmarco-t5-base-v1) by default) model to generate `queries_per_passage` queries for each passage in the unlabeled corpus. The query-passage pairs are viewed as **positive examples** for training.
    > Result files (under path `$path_to_generated_data`): (1) `${qgen}-qrels/train.tsv`, (2) `${qgen}-queries.jsonl` and also (3) `corpus.jsonl` (copied from `$evaluation_data/`);
2. Then, it runs negative mining with the generated queries as input on the target corpus. The mined passages will be viewed as **negative examples** for training. One can specify any dense retrievers ([SBERT](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) or [Huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) checkpoints, we use [msmarco-distilbert-base-v3](sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-v3) + [msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3) by default) or BM25 to the argument `retrievers` as the negative miner.
    > Result file (under path `$path_to_generated_data`): hard-negatives.jsonl;
3. Finally, it does pseudo labeling with the powerful cross-encoders (we use [cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) by default.) on the query-passage pairs that we have so far (for both positive and negative examples).
    > Result file (under path `$path_to_generated_data`): `gpl-training-data.tsv`. It contains (`gpl_steps` * `batch_size_gpl`) tuples in total.

Up to now, we have the actual training data ready. One can look at [sample-data/generated/fiqa](sample-data/generated/fiqa) for a quick example about the data format. The very last step is to apply the [MarginMSE loss](gpl/toolkit/loss.py) to teach the student retriever to mimic the margin scores, CE(query, positive) - CE(query, negative) labeled by the teacher model (Cross-Encoder, CE). And of course, **the MarginMSE step** is included in GPL and will be done **automatically**:). Note that MarginMSE works with dot-product and thus the final models trained with **GPL works with dot-product**.

PS: The `--retrievers` are for negative mining. They can be any dense retrievers trained on the general domain (e.g. MS MARCO) and do **not need to be strong for the target task/domain**. Please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07577) for more details (cf. Table 7).

## Customized data
One can also replace/put the customized data for any intermediate step under the path `$path_to_generated_data` with the same name fashion. GPL will skip the intermediate steps by using these provided data.

As a typical workflow, one might only have the (English) unlabeld corpus and want a good model performing well for this corpus. To run GPL training under such condition, one just needs these steps:
1. Prepare your corpus in the same format as the [data sample](https://github.com/UKPLab/gpl/blob/main/sample-data/generated/fiqa/corpus.jsonl);
2. Put your `corpus.jsonl` under a folder, e.g. named as "generated" for data loading and data generation by GPL;
3. Call gpl.train with the folder path as an input argument: (other arguments work as usual)
```bash
python -m gpl.train \
    --path_to_generated_data "generated" \
    --output_dir "output" \
    --new_size -1 \
    --queries_per_passage -1
```

## Pre-trained checkpoints and generated data
### Pre-trained checkpoints
We now release the pre-trained GPL models via the https://huggingface.co/GPL. There are currently five types of models:

1. `GPL/${dataset}-msmarco-distilbert-gpl`: Model with training order of (1) MarginMSE on MSMARCO -> (2) GPL on `${dataset}`;
2. `GPL/${dataset}-tsdae-msmarco-distilbert-gpl`: Model with training order of (1) TSDAE on `${dataset}` -> (2) MarginMSE on MSMARCO -> (3) GPL on `${dataset}`;
3. `GPL/msmarco-distilbert-margin-mse`: Model trained on MSMARCO with MarginMSE;
4. `GPL/${dataset}-tsdae-msmarco-distilbert-margin-mse`: Model with training order of (1) TSDAE on ${dataset} -> (2) MarginMSE on MSMARCO;
5. `GPL/${dataset}-distilbert-tas-b-gpl-self_miner`: Starting from the [tas-b model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b), the models were trained with GPL on the target corpus `${dataset}` with the base model itself as the negative miner (here noted as "self_miner"). 

Models 1. and 2. were actually trained on top of models 3. and 4. resp. All GPL models were trained the automatic setting of `new_size` and `queries_per_passage` (by setting them to `-1`). This automatic setting can keep the performance while being efficient. For more details, please refer to the section 4.1 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07577).

Among these models, `GPL/${dataset}-distilbert-tas-b-gpl-self_miner` ones works the best on the [BeIR](https://github.com/UKPLab/beir) benchmark:
![](imgs/beir.jpg)

For reproducing the results with the same package versions used in the experiments, please refer to the conda environment file, [environment.yml](environment.yml).

### Generated data
We now release the generated data used in the experiments of the [GPL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07577): 

1. The generated data for the main experiments on the 6 BeIR datasets: https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/kwang/gpl/generated-data/main/;
2. The generated data for the experiments on the full 18 BeIR datasets: https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/kwang/gpl/generated-data/beir.

Please note that the 4 datasets of `bioasq`, `robust04`, `trec-news` and `signal1m` are only available after registration with the original official authorities. We only release the document IDs for these corpora with the file name `corpus.doc_ids.txt`. For more details, please refer to the [BeIR](https://github.com/UKPLab/beir) repository.
